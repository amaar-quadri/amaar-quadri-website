# My Personal Website
This repository contains a Django project for hosting my personal website.
The front-end is created using React and Bootstrap.

## Repository Notes
The dev branch represents the active working branch. \
The master branch represents a stable release, which is being deployed on my personal Raspberry Pi web server. \
The master branch is perpetually ahead of the dev branch by a single commit, which corresponds to updates to
`website/website/settings.py` that ensure that the proper settings are enabled for a live deployment.
